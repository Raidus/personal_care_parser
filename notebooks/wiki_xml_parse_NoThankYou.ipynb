The suffix [[-ism]] denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy.{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} The word anarchism appears in English from 1642{{sfn|Definition of Anarchism by Merriam-Webster|2019}} as \\'\\'anarchisme\\'\\'<ref>{{cite OED|anarchism}}</ref> and the word \\'\\'anarchy\\'\\' from 1539.<ref>{{cite OED|anarchy}}</ref> Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as anarchists, although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}\\n\\nThe first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist ({{lang-fr|anarchiste}}) was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} the term [[libertarianism]] has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|Guerin|1970|loc=The Basic Ideas of Anarchism}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1= Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=Fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to [[Individualist anarchism|individualistic free-market philosophy]] only, referring to [[free-market anarchism]] as libertarian anarchism.{{sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}\\n\\nWhile [[Anti-statism|opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of talk among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p= 217}} Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organization]] (including the [[State (polity)|state]], [[Anarchism and capitalism| capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism| nationalism]] and all associated [[institution]]s) in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[voluntary association]], on [[freedom]] and on [[decentralisation]], but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an \\'\\'a posteriori\\'\\' conclusion).{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25–29|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2pp=217}}\\n\\nNonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following:{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}\\n# The will for a non-coercive society.\\n# The rejection of the state apparatus.\\n# The belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society.\\n# A suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of [[anarchy]].\\n\\n== History ==\\n{{main|History of anarchism}}\\n\\n===Prehistoric and ancient world===\\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BC), whose \\'\\'[[Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]\\'\\' inspired [[Peter Kropotkin]]{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=70}}]]\\nDuring the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction.{{sfn|Graham|2005|pp=xi–xiv}} Most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in [[History of China|China]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. In China, [[philosophical anarchism]] was delineated by [[Taoism|Taoist philosophers]] [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] and [[Lao Tzu]].{{sfnm|1a1=Coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}} Likewise in Greece, anarchic attitudes were articulated by tragedians and philosophers. [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] used the myth of [[Antigone]] to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and [[autonomy|personal autonomy]]. [[Socrates]] questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (\\'\\'nomos\\'\\') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (\\'\\'physis\\'\\'). [[Stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4, 66–73}}\\n\\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the Islamic world or in Christian Europe. This kind of tradition later gave birth to [[religious anarchism]]. In Persia, [[Mazdak]] called for an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian society]] and the [[abolition of monarchy]], only to be soon executed by the king.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=86}} In [[Basra]], religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Libertarian ideas further emerged during the [[Renaissance]] with the spread of [[Rationalism|reasoning]] and [[humanism]] through Europe. Novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Matthew|date=14 January 2014|title=The Possibilities of Anarchist History: Rethinking the Canon and Writing History|url=https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/adcs/article/view/17138|journal=Anarchist Developments in Cultural Studies|volume=2013.1: Blasting the Canon|pages=33–63|accessdate=17 December 2019|via=University of Victoria Libraries}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Modern era ===\\nThe turning point towards anarchism was the [[French Revolution]] in which the anti-state and federalist sentiments began to take a form, mostly by [[Enragés]] and \\'\\'[[sans-culottes]]\\'\\'.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=4}} Some prominent figures of anarchism begun developing the first anarchist currents.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}} This era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the Spanish Civil War of 1936 and is considered the golden age of anarchism.

Bakunin\\'s current ([[Jura Federation]]) entered the [[International Workingmen\\'s Association]], a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant organisation, and [[Karl Marx]] a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Proudhon\\'s followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx\\'s [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.{{sfnm|1a1=Dodson|1y=2002|1p=312|2a1=Thomas|2y=1985|2p=187|3a1=Chaliand|3a2=Blin|3y=2007|3p=116}} Bakunin\\'s followers entered a bitter dispute with Marx which ended in 1872 with the split of the workers movement that officially took place in [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague]].{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1y=2019|1pp=334–336|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=24}} Marx advocating the creation of a political party to take part in electoral struggles which Bakunin strongly rejected.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=24–25}} Bakunin famously predicted that if such a party would gain power by Marxist\\'s terms, it would end up as the new tyrant of workers. After being expelled, anarchists formed the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier International]]. Under the influence of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian philosopher and scientist, [[anarcho-communism]] overlapped with collectivism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=5}} Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], advocated for free federation and distribution of goods according to one needs.{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=xii}}\\n\\nAt the turning of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world.{{sfn|Moya|2015|p=327}} In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=519–521}} Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, pouring into the Japanese capital to study.{{sfnm|1a1=Dirlik|1y=1991|1p=133|2a1=Ramnath|2y=2019|2pp=681–682}} In [[Latin America]], [[Anarchism in Argentina|São Paulo]] was a stronghold and anarcho-syndicalism was the most prominent left-wing ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=Laursen|2y=2019|2p=157|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3pp=504–508}} During this time, a minority of anarchists embarked upon violent means to achieve political ends. This strategy became known as [[propaganda of the deed]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many [[Communards]] to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts.{{sfn|Anderson|2004}} Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} [[Illegalism]] was another strategy which some anarchists adopted these same years.{{sfn|Bantman|2019|p=374}}\\n\\n[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]\\nAnarchists enthusiastically participated in the [[Russian Revolution]]—despite concern—in opposition to the [[White movement|Whites]]. However, they met harsh suppression after the [[Bolshevik government]] was stabilized. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine,{{sfn|Avrich|2006|p=204}} notably leading to the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and [[Nestor Makhno]]\\'s struggle in the [[Free Territory]]. With the anarchists being crushed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely [[platformism]] and [[synthesis anarchism]]. Platformists sought to create a coherent group that would push for the revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. The victory of the Bolsheviks in the [[October Revolution]] and the resulting [[Russian Civil War]] did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally—where many workers and activists saw the Bolshevik success as setting an example and [[Communist party|communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements.

In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists.{{sfn|Kowal|2019|p=271}} The second wave of anarcha-feminism arose in the 1960s.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=672–673}}\\n\\n==== Anarcho-capitalism ====\\n{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}\\n[[Anarcho-capitalism]] advocates the elimination of the state in favour of self-ownership in a free market.{{sfnm|1a1=Hamowy|1y=2008|1pp=10–12, 195|2a1=Stringham|2y=2017|2p=51}} Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical American anti-state [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarianism]] and [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|individualist anarchism]],{{sfn|Outhwaite|2008|p=14}} drawing from [[Austrian School]] economics, study of [[law and economics]] and [[public choice theory]].{{sfn|Stringham|2005}} However, the overall consensus among anarchists believes that anarcho-capitalism cannot be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement which opposes private property over the means of production and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as [[Anarchism and capitalism|incompatible]] with capitalist forms.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=565|ps=: \"In fact, few anarchists would accept the \\'anarcho-capitalists\\' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice, Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid.

It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition\".}}{{sfn|Newman|2010|p=53|ps=: \"It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard\\'s anarcho-capitalism)\".}}\\n\\n== Internal issues and debates ==\\n{{main|Issues in anarchism}}\\n<!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. -->\\nAs anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought and disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common, its diversity has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. For instance, the compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{sfn|Honderich|1995|p=31}} [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]], [[collectivism]] and [[trade unionism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[Veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]]) and the [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. On a tactical level, [[propaganda of the deed]] was used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[nihilist movement]]), with some contemporary anarchists espousing alternative direct action methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one while others do so by local ones.{{sfn|Trevijano|2001|p=57}}\\n\\n== Topics of interest ==\\nIntersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.\\n\\n=== Anarchism and free love ===\\n{{main|Free love}}\\n{{see also|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex|Queer anarchism}}\\n[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Émile Armand]] propounded the virtues of [[free love]] in the [[Anarchism in France|Parisian anarchist milieu]] of the early 20th century]]\\nAn important current within anarchism is [[free love]].{{sfn|McElroy|1996}} In Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was [[Émile Armand]]. He proposed the concept of \\'\\'la camaraderie amoureuse\\'\\' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].{{sfn|Ronsin|2000}} In Germany, the [[Stirnerism|Stirnerists]] Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]]. More recently, the British anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual \\'\\'[[The Joy of Sex]]\\'\\'. The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as \\'\\'Théorie du corps amoureux. Pour une érotique solaire\\'\\' (2000) and \\'\\'L\\'invention du plaisir. Fragments cyréaniques\\'\\' (2002).\\n\\n=== Anarchism and education ===\\n{{main|Anarchism and education}}\\n[[File:Francisco Ferrer Guardia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], [[Anarchism in Spain|Catalan anarchist]] pedagogue and [[Freethought|free thinker]]]]\\nEnglish anarchist William Godwin considered education an important aspect. He was against state education as he considered those schools as a way of the state to replicate privileges of the ruling class.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|p=514}} Godwin thought that education was the way to change the world. In his \\'\\'[[Political Justice]]\\'\\', he criticises state sponsored schooling and advocates for child\\'s protection from coercion.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=197}} Max Stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called \\'\\'[[The False Principle of our Education]]\\'\\' in which Stirner was advocating for child\\'s autonomy.{{sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1p=521|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=222}}\\n\\nIn 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer|Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established [[Ferrer movement|modern]] or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Fidler|1985|pp=103–132}} Ferrer\\'s approach was secular, rejecting both the state and church involvement in the educational process and gave pupils plenty of autonomy (i.e. on setting the curriculum). Ferrer was aiming to educate the working class. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later on arrested.{{sfnm|1a1=Bookchin|1y=1998|1p=115|2a1=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=511–514}} Ferrer\\'s ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] in the United States.{{sfn|Fidler|1985|pp=103–132}}\\n\\nRussian Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate.{{sfn|Hern|2010}} Tolstoy\\'s educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.{{sfn|Wilson|2001|p=xxi}} Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture.{{sfn|Hern|2010}} He thought that \"[e]ducation is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself. [...] Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary\".{{sfn|Hern|2010}} For him, \"without compulsion, education was transformed into culture\".{{sfn|Hern|2010}}\\n\\nA more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.{{sfn|Purkis|2004}} Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=129}} However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach.{{sfn|Suissa|2007}} In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]] was popularised by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.{{sfn|Illich|1971}}\\n\\n=== Anarchism and the state ===\\n<!-- Important! Strive to explain how anarchists perceive authority and oppression and why they reject them. Jun (2019), p. 41. -->\\nObjection to the state and its institutions is \\'\\'[[sine qua non]]\\'\\' of anarchism.{{sfn|Carter|1971|p=14}} Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and it is illegitimate regardless of political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless if it is [[Open government|open]] or [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]] as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that some people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the argument that the state is the collective will of people as a fairy tale since the [[ruling class]] is distinct from the rest of the society.{{sfn|Jun|2019|pp=32–38}}\\n\\n=== Anarchism and violence ===\\n{{main|Anarchism and violence}}\\n[[File:McKinleyAssassination.jpg|thumb|Which forms of violence, if any, are [[Anarchism and violence|consistent with anarchist values]] is a controversial subject among anarchists. Image is of [[Leon Czolgosz]]\\'s [[assassination of William McKinley|assassinating]] American [[President of the United States|President]] [[William McKinley]].]]\\n\\nAnarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexed and controversial.{{sfn|Carter|1978|p=320}} On one hand, anarcho-pacifists point out the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|p=\"One significant philosophical and ethical problem for politically engaged anarchists is the question of how to avoid ongoing cycles of power and violence that are likely to erupt in the absence of centralized political power. One suggestion [...] is that anarchists will often want to emphasize the unity of means and ends. This idea shows why there is some substantial overlap and conjunction between anarchism and pacifism. Pacifist typically emphasize the unity of means and ends. But not all pacifists are anarchists\"}} On the other hand, other groups of anarchist are for direct action that can include sabotage or even terrorism. [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], who were proponents of limited use of violence, were arguing that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a [[necessary evil]]. Peace activist and anarchist [[April Carter]] argues that violence is incompatible with anarchism because it is mostly associated with the state and authority as violence is immanent to the state. As the state\\'s capability to exercise violence is colossal nowadays, a rebellion or civil war would probably end in another authoritarian institute.{{sfn|Carter|1978|pp=320–325}}\\n\\n=== Anarchist strategies and tactics ===\\nA broad categorization would be the preference of revolutionary tactics to destroy oppressive states and institutions or aiming to change society through evolutionary means. Revolutionary methods can take violent form as they did in past insurgencies (i.e. in Spain, Mexico and Russia) or during violent protests by militant protestors such as the [[black bloc]], who are generally much less violent than revolutionary movements a century ago. Anarchists also commonly employ [[direct action]] which can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchies, or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counterinstitutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives.{{sfn|Williams|2017|pp=4–5}} Often decision-making is handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as [[Horizontalidad|horizontalism]]. Another aspect of anarchist tactics is their aim to strengthen social bonds through common actions.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109–217}} Reclaiming public space by anarchists is another method of creating social spaces and creating squats in order to organise themselves. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called [[temporary autonomous zone]]s.{{sfn|Williams|2017|pp=5–6}}\\n\\n== Criticism{{anchor|Criticisms}} ==\\nMoral and pragmatic criticism of anarchism includes allegations of utopianism, tacit authoritarianism and vandalism towards feats of civilisation.\\n\\n=== Allegation of utopianism ===\\nAnarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or [[utopian]] by its critics, often in general and formal debate. European history professor Carl Landauer argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a \"lesser evil\" than a society without \"repressive force\". He also argued that \"ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears\" is an \"absurdity\".{{sfn|Landauer|1959}} However, \\'\\'[[An Anarchist FAQ]]\\'\\' states the following: \"Anarchy is not a utopia, [and] anarchists make no such claims about human perfection. [...] Remaining disputes would be solved by reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties, or community and workplace assemblies\". It also states that \"some sort of \\'court\\' system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens\".{{sfnm|1a1=Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective|1y=2017|1loc=A.2.16 Does anarchism require \"perfect\" people to work?|2a1=Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective|2y=2017|2loc=I.5.8 What about crime?}}\\n\\n=== Industrial civilisation ===\\nIn his essay \\'\\'On Authority\\'\\', [[Friedrich Engels]] claimed that radical [[decentralisation]] promoted by anarchists would destroy modern [[Industrial civilization|industrial civilisation]], citing an example of [[railway]]s and making the following point:{{sfn|Engels|1978}} {{quote|Here too the co-operation of an infinite number of individuals is absolutely necessary, and this co-operation must be practised during precisely fixed hours so that no accidents may happen. Here, too, the first condition of the job is a dominant will that settles all subordinate questions, whether this will is represented by a single delegate or a committee charged with the execution of the resolutions of the majority of persona interested. In either case there is a very pronounced authority. Moreover, what would happen to the first train dispatched if the authority of the railway employees over the Hon. passengers were abolished?}}\\n\\nIn the end, it is argued that authority in any form is a natural occurrence which should not be abolished.{{sfn|Goodwin|2014}}\\n\\n=== Tacit authoritarianism ===\\nThe anarchist tendency known as [[platformism]] has been criticised by [[Situationist International|Situationists]],{{sfn|Debord|1993|loc=Paragraph 91}} [[Insurrectionary anarchism|insurrectionaries]], [[Synthesis anarchism|synthesis anarchists]] and others of preserving tacitly statist, authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\\n\\n== List of anarchist societies ==\\n{{Main list|List of anarchist communities}}\\n\\n* [[Fejuve|Federation of Neighborhood Councils-El Alto]] (Fejuve; 1979–present){{sfn|Gelderloss|2010}}\\n* [[Popular Indigenous Council of Oaxaca \"Ricardo Flores Magón\"]] (CIPO-RFM; 1980s–present){{sfn|Denham|2008}}\\n* [[Barbacha]] (2001–present){{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\\n* [[Villa de Zaachila]] (2006–present){{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\\n* [[Cherán|Cheran]] (2011–present){{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\\n* [[Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]] (Rojava; 2013–present){{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\\n\\n== See also ==\\n{{Portal|Anarchism|Libertarianism}}\\n* [[:Category:Anarchism by country|Anarchism by country]]\\n* [[Governance without government]]\\n* [[List of political ideologies#Anarchism|List of anarchist political ideologies]]\\n* [[List of books about anarchism]]\\n\\n== References ==\\n=== Citations ===\\n{{Reflist|25em}}\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\n; Primary sources\\n{{refbegin|35em|indent=yes}}\\n* {{cite book |author=Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective|title=An Anarchist FAQ|year=2017|ref=harv|title-link=An Anarchist FAQ }}\\n* {{cite book |last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|author-link=Mikhail Bakunin|title=Statism and Anarchy|title-link=Statism and Anarchy|year=1990|orig-year=1873|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England |series=Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought|translator-last=Shatz|translator-first=Marshall|isbn=978-0-521-36182-8|oclc=20826465|lccn=89077393|doi=10.1017/CBO9781139168083|ref=harv }}\\n* {{cite book|last=Berkman|first=Alexander|author-link=Alexander Berkman|title=Now and After: The ABC of Communist Anarchism|title-link=Now and After|year=1929|publisher=Vanguard Press|location=New York|oclc=529173|lccn=29022523|ref=harv}}\\n* {{cite book |author=Dielo Trouda|author-link=Dielo Truda|title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)|year=2006|orig-year=1926|translator-last=McNab|translator-first=Nestor|publisher=Nestor Makhno Archive |url = http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/newplatform/org_plat.htm |access-date=18 March 2019|ref=harv}}\\n* {{cite book|last=Engels|first=Fredrich|author-link=Friedrich Engels|editor-last=Tucker|editor-first=Robert C.|title=The Marx-Engels reader|edition=2nd|chapter=On Authority|year=1978|orig-year=1874|publisher=Norton|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-0-393-05684-6|oclc=318414641|lccn=77016635|ref=harv|chapter-url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm|access-date=18 March 2019|via=Marxists Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/marxengelsreader00tuck}}\\n* {{cite book |last=Godwin|first=William|author-link=William Godwin |title=Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and Its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners |year=1798|orig-year=1793|edition=3rd, corrected |publisher=G.

Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.<ref name=\"PhysicsWorld\">{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo – from Eric Weisstein\\'s World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref> The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 0.3.<ref name=\"Goode\"/> This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.\\n\\n[[File:Ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|upright=1.2|left|2003–2004 mean annual clear-sky and total-sky albedo]]\\nEarth\\'s surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]\\'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites, and the CERES instrument on the [[Suomi NPP]] and [[Joint Polar Satellite System|JPSS]]. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,<ref name=\"NASA\"/>). These calculations are based on the [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.\\n\\nEarth\\'s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15&nbsp;°C.

The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (\"phase angle\"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.\\n\\n[[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.99.

[[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rainforest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\\n\\nArctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the [[Earth]]. This has been a concern since arctic ice and [[snow]] has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space.

A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.\\n\\n===Snow===\\nSnow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.<ref>Hall, D.K. and Martinec, J. (1985), \\'\\'Remote sensing of ice and snow\\'\\'. Chapman and Hall, New York, 189 pp.</ref> Over [[Antarctica]] snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo [[positive feedback]]).\\n\\nJust as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback.<ref>\"All About Sea Ice.\" National Snow and Ice Data Center. Accessed 16 November 2017. /cryosphere/seaice/index.html.</ref> Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for [[global warming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\\n\\n[[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.<ref name = \"Nat.

Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\\n\\n===Small-scale effects===\\nAlbedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.<ref name=\"ranknfile-ue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool!

The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).\\n\\nAt the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.<ref name=\"Fresnel\" />\\n\\nAlthough the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.\\n\\nNote that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh \\'black\\' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.\\nSnow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\\n\\n===Clouds===\\n[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. \"On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water.

In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.\\n\\nThe [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic script|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin|Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.\\n\\n===Typographic variants===\\n[[File:A-small glyphs.svg|thumb|140px|Different [[glyphs]] of the lowercase letter A.]]\\nDuring Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter \"A\". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other \"permanent\" media. There was also a [[cursive]] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the \"perishable\" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.<ref name=Americana>{{harvnb|Diringer|2000|p=1}}</ref>\\n\\n[[File:LowercaseA.svg|left|thumb|200px|[[Allography|Typographic variants]] include a double-storey \\'\\'\\'a\\'\\'\\' and single-storey \\'\\'\\'ɑ\\'\\'\\'.]]At the end of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[Italy]], the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the [[Carolingian minuscule|Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.<ref name=Americana/>\\n\\n15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the \\'\\'Italic\\'\\' and \\'\\'Roman\\'\\' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called \\'\\'script a,\\'\\' is used in most current [[handwriting]] and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it (\"a\").<ref name=Americana/> Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.\\n\\n[[Italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where \\'\\'script a\\'\\' (\"ɑ\"), also called [[Latin alpha]], is used in contrast with Latin \"a\" (such as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]).\\n\\n==Use in writing systems==\\n[[File:Pronunciation of the name of the letter ⟨a⟩ in European languages.png|thumb|Pronunciation of the name of the letter {{angbr|a}} in European languages, note that /a/ and /aː/ can differ phonetically between {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPAblink|ä}}, {{IPAblink|æ}} and {{IPAblink|ɑ}} depending on the language.|305x305px]]\\n===English===\\n{{further information|Pronunciation of English ⟨a⟩}}\\nIn modern [[English orthography]], the letter {{angbr|a}} represents at least seven different vowel sounds:\\n*the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/æ/}} as in \\'\\'pad\\'\\';\\n*the [[open back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɑː/}} as in \\'\\'father\\'\\', which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound;<ref name=Coll/>\\n*the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/eɪ/}} as in \\'\\'ace\\'\\' and \\'\\'major\\'\\' (usually when {{vr|a}} is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letter) – this results from [[Middle English lengthening]] followed by the [[Great Vowel Shift]];\\n*the modified form of the above sound that occurs [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|before {{vr|r}}]], as in \\'\\'square\\'\\' and \\'\\'Mary\\'\\';\\n*the rounded vowel of \\'\\'water\\'\\';\\n*the shorter rounded vowel (not present in [[General American]]) in \\'\\'was\\'\\' and \\'\\'what\\'\\';<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\\n*a [[schwa]], in many unstressed syllables, as in \\'\\'about\\'\\', \\'\\'comma\\'\\', \\'\\'solar\\'\\'.\\n\\nThe double {{angbr|aa}} sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as \\'\\'Aaron\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[aardvark]]\\'\\'.<ref>{{harvnb|Gelb|Whiting|1998|p=45}}</ref> However, {{vr|a}} occurs in [[List of Latin-script digraphs|many common digraphs]], all with their own sound or sounds, particularly {{vr|ai}}, {{vr|au}}, {{vr|aw}}, {{vr|ay}}, {{vr|ea}} and {{vr|oa}}.\\n\\n{{angbr|a}} is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|t}}),<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2004}}</ref> and the second most common in Spanish and French.

Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against African Americans from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until at least the 1970s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and [[African Americans]] were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state\\'s economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests.

One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\\n\\n[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]\\n\\nAlabama\\'s government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\\n\\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In \\'\\'[[Reynolds v. Sims]]\\'\\' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\\n\\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\\n\\n[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor [[Kay Ivey]] is the current and second female [[governor of Alabama]].

Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\\n\\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.<ref name=\"home\"/> Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in \\'\\'[[Baker v. Carr]]\\'\\' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\\n\\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama\\'s constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"<ref name=\"home\">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P.

In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\\n\\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\\n\\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\\n\\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state\\'s only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\"/> and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\\n\\nIn 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\\n\\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\\n\\n{{as of|2017|December|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref>\\n\\n===Elections===\\n{{main|Elections in Alabama}}\\n[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected in a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election in 2017]].]]\\n\\n====State elections====\\nWith the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of Blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the \"[[Solid South]]\", a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid to late 20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\\n\\nMembers of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\\n\\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\\n\\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[Freedman|freedmen]] who had gained the franchise.

He was the son of the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], king of [[Phthia]].\\n\\nAchilles\\' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince [[Hector]] outside the gates of [[Troy]]. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the \\'\\'Iliad\\'\\', other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with [[Statius]]\\' unfinished epic \\'\\'[[Achilleid]]\\'\\', written in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel because, when his mother [[Thetis]] dipped him in the river [[Styx]] as an infant, she held him by one of his heels. Alluding to these legends, the term \"[[Achilles\\' heel]]\" has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution. The [[Achilles tendon]] is also named after him due to these legends.\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\n\\n[[Linear B]] tablets attest to the personal name \\'\\'Achilleus\\'\\' in the forms \\'\\'a-ki-re-u\\'\\' and \\'\\'a-ki-re-we\\'\\',<ref name=\"New Pauly\">{{cite encyclopedia|author1=Dorothea Sigel|title=Achilles|author2=Anne Ley|author3=Bruno Bleckmann|entry=Achilles|encyclopedia=Brill\\'s New Pauly|editor=Hubert Cancik |display-editors=etal |publisher=Brill Reference Online|doi=10.1163/1574-9347_bnp_e102220}} Accessed 5 May 2017.</ref> the latter being the [[dative case|dative]] of the former.<ref name=Beekes/> The name grew more popular, even becoming common soon after the seventh century BC<ref>[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/search?patt=*AXIL&first=250 Epigraphical database]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} gives 476 matches for Ἀχιλ-.The earliest ones: [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=27810&bookid=6&region=2&subregion=1 Corinth 7th c.

Furthermore, \\'\\'laós\\'\\' has been construed by [[Gregory Nagy]], following [[Leonard Palmer]], to mean \"a corps of soldiers\", a [[muster (military)|muster]].<ref name=Nagy/> With this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war.

Achilles\\' wrath (μῆνις Ἀχιλλέως, \\'\\'mênis Achilléōs\\'\\') is the central theme of the poem. The first two lines of the \\'\\'Iliad\\'\\' read:\\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\\n|Μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληιάδεω Ἀχιλῆος<br>\\nοὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί\\' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε\\' ἔθηκε, [...]\\n|Sing, Goddess, of the rage of Peleus\\' son Achilles,<br>\\nthe accursed rage that brought great suffering to the Achaeans, [...]\\n|}\\n\\nThe Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles\\' death. It begins with Achilles\\' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] forces. Agamemnon has taken a woman named [[Chryseis]] as his slave. Her father [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo]], begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses, and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet [[Calchas]] correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so, and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles\\' battle prize [[Briseis]], the daughter of [[Briseus]], be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis),<ref>\\'\\'Iliad\\'\\' 9.334–343.</ref> with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon\\'s theft, Achilles [[Homeric prayer|prays]] to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honour.\\n\\nAs the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sends [[Odysseus]] and two other chieftains, [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]], to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.\\n\\n[[File:The Rage of Achilles by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|left|\\'\\'The Rage of Achilles\\'\\', fresco by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] (1757, Villa Valmarana ai Nani, Vicenza)]]\\n\\nThe Trojans, led by [[Hector]], subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, [[Patroclus]] leads the [[Myrmidons]] into battle, wearing Achilles\\' armour, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.\\n\\nAfter receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from [[Antilochus]], the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion\\'s death. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades [[Hephaestus]] to make new armour for him, in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by Hector. The new armour includes the [[Shield of Achilles]], described in great detail in the poem.\\n\\nEnraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god [[Scamander]], who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by [[Hera]] and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles\\' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before [[Athena]], in the form of Hector\\'s favorite and dearest brother, [[Deiphobus]], persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that \"my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me\".<ref>\"The Iliad\", Fagles translation.

During the cremation of Patroclus, he is compared to [[Hesperus]], the evening/western star ([[Venus]]), while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]], the morning/eastern star (also Venus) has set (descended).\\n\\nWith the assistance of the god [[Hermes]] (Argeiphontes), Hector\\'s father [[Priam]] goes to Achilles\\' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector\\'s body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral, lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th (in the tradition of [[Niobe]]\\'s offspring). The poem ends with a description of Hector\\'s funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.\\n\\n=== Later epic accounts: fighting Penthesilea and Memnon ===\\n\\n[[File:Akhilleus Memnon Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1410.jpg|thumb|Achilles and Memnon fighting, between Thetis and Eos, Attic black-figure amphora, c. 510 BC, from Vulci]]\\n\\nThe \\'\\'[[Aethiopis]]\\'\\' (7th century BC) and a work named \\'\\'[[Posthomerica]]\\'\\', composed by [[Quintus of Smyrna]] in the fourth century AD, relate further events from the [[Trojan War]].

After his temporary truce with Priam, Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen, only to grieve over her death later.<ref>[[Propertius]], 3.11.15; [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] 1.</ref> At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual.

When [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], son of the Dawn Goddess [[Eos]] and king of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]], slays Antilochus, Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. Consequently, Eos will not let the sun rise, until Zeus persuades her. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.\\n\\nMany Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the \\'\\'Iliad\\'\\'{{\\'}}s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles\\' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] \\'\\'[[Aethiopis]]\\'\\', which was composed after the \\'\\'Iliad\\'\\', possibly in the 7th century BC.

Commentators from [[classical antiquity]] to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek custom of \\'\\'paiderasteia\\'\\']]. In Plato\\'s \\'\\'Symposium\\'\\', the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.<ref>[[Plato]], \\'\\'[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]\\'\\', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Sym.+180a 180a]; the beauty of Achilles was a topic already broached at \\'\\'Iliad\\'\\' 2.673–674.</ref> But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]],<ref>[[Kenneth Dover]], \\'\\'Greek Homosexuality\\'\\' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 1 \\'\\'et passim\\'\\'.</ref> and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. Many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship.\\n\\n=== Death ===\\n{{anchor|Fatalwound}}\\n\\nThe death of Achilles, even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources, is a complex one, with many different versions.<ref>Abrantes 2016: c. 4.3.1</ref> In the oldest one, the \\'\\'Iliad\\'\\', and as predicted by [[Hector]] with his dying breath, the hero\\'s death was brought about by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god [[Apollo]] guided Paris\\' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow. All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valour, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of [[Patroclus]], and funeral games were held. He was represented in the \\'\\'Aethiopis\\'\\' as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]].\\n\\n[[File:Closeup of Achilles thniskon in Corfu Achilleion autocorrected.JPG|thumb|left|\\'\\'Dying Achilles\\'\\' (Achilleas thniskon) in the gardens of the Achilleion]]\\n\\nAnother version of Achilles\\' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, [[Polyxena]]. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena\\'s hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world\\'s greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.\\n\\nIn the \\'\\'Odyssey\\'\\', Agamemnon informs Achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his [[mound]] at the [[Hellespont]] while they are receiving the dead [[Suitors of Penelope|suitors]] in Hades.<ref>\\'\\'Odyssey\\'\\' 24.36–94.</ref> He claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of Ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the Ocean.<ref>{{Cite book\\n| title = The Odyssey of Homer\\n| author= Richmond Lattimore\\n| publisher = Harper Perennial\\n| year = 2007\\n| isbn = 978-0-06-124418-6\\n| location = New York\\n| page = 347\\n}}</ref> Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus.<ref>E.

They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men, decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned him the ire of Athena. Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armour to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles.\\n\\nA relic claimed to be Achilles\\' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of [[Phaselis]], Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf.

A second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. A fifth century BC [[Black-glazed Ware|black-glazed]] [[lekythos]] inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads: \"Glaukos, son of Poseidon, dedicated me to Achilles, lord of Leuke.\" In another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC, a statue is dedicated to Achilles, lord of Leuke, by a citizen of Olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island\\'s cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.<ref name=Hedreen/>\\n\\nThe heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on \\'\\'Leuce\\'\\' seems to go back to an account from the lost epic \\'\\'[[Aethiopis]]\\'\\' according to which, after his untimely death, Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical Λεύκη Νῆσος (\\'\\'Leúkē Nêsos\\'\\' \"White Island\").<ref>[[Proclus]], \\'\\'Chrestomathia\\'\\' 2.</ref> Already in the fifth century BC, [[Pindar]] had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a \"bright island\" (φαεννά νᾶσος, \\'\\'phaenná nâsos\\'\\') of the Black Sea,<ref>Pindar, \\'\\'Nemea\\'\\' 4.49ff.; Arrian, \\'\\'[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]\\'\\' 21.</ref> while in another of his works, Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite [[Island of the Blest]] together with other heroes such as his father [[Peleus]] and [[Cadmus]].<ref>Pindar, \\'\\'Olympia\\'\\' 2.78ff.</ref> Well known is the connection of these mythological [[Fortunate Isles]] (μακαρῶν νῆσοι, \\'\\'makárôn nêsoi\\'\\') or the Homeric [[Elysium]] with the stream [[Oceanus]] which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it.<ref name=Hedreen/> Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], speaking of \"Achilles lord of Scythia\"<ref>D. Page, \\'\\'Lyrica Graeca Selecta\\'\\', Oxford 1968, p. 89, no. 166.</ref> and the opposition of North and South, as evoked by Achilles\\' fight against the [[Aethiopia]]n prince [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother [[Eos]] after his death.\\n\\nThe \\'\\'[[Periplus Ponti Euxini|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]\\'\\' (c. 130 AD) gives the following details:\\n\\n{{quote|It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus\\' honour, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honour Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles\\' temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles\\' honour. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles\\' oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn\\'t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships.<ref name=\"Densuşianu\"/>}}\\n\\nThe Greek geographer [[Dionysius Periegetes]], who lived probably during the first century AD, wrote that the island was called \\'\\'Leuce\\'\\' \"because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour\".<ref>Dionysius Periegetes, \\'\\'Orbis descriptio\\'\\' 5.541, quoted in Densuşianu 1913.</ref> Similarly, others relate the island\\'s name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there.<ref name=Hedreen/><ref>Arrian, \\'\\'[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]\\'\\' 21; Scholion to Pindar, \\'\\'Nemea\\'\\' 4.79.</ref> [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is \"covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles\\' temple and his statue\".<ref>Pausanias, \\'\\'Description of Greece\\'\\' 3.19.11.</ref> Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing.

[[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Strabo]] reported on the existence of a town \\'\\'Achílleion\\'\\' (Ἀχίλλειον), built by settlers from [[Mytilene]] in the sixth century BC, close to the hero\\'s presumed burial mound in the [[Troad]].<ref name=Troad/> Later attestations point to an \\'\\'Achílleion\\'\\' in [[Messenia]] (according to [[Stephanus Byzantinus]]) and an \\'\\'Achílleios\\'\\' (Ἀχίλλειος) in [[Laconia]].<ref>Pausanias, \\'\\'Description of Greece\\'\\' 3.25.4.</ref> [[Nicolae Densuşianu]] recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of [[Aquileia]] and of the northern arm of the Danube delta, called [[Chilia Veche|Chilia]] (presumably from an older \\'\\'Achileii\\'\\'), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.<ref name=\"Densuşianu\">Nicolae Densuşianu: \\'\\'Dacia preistorică\\'\\'. Bucharest: Carol Göbl, 1913.</ref>\\n\\nThe kings of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, [[Neoptolemus]]. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epirote princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at [[Achilleion (Troad)#Tomb of Achilles|Achilleion]] while passing Troy.<ref>[[Arrian]], \\'\\'[[Anabasis Alexandri]]\\'\\' 1.12.1, [[Cicero]], \\'\\'Pro Archia Poeta\\'\\' 24.</ref> In AD 216 the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]], while on his way to war against [[Parthia]], emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles\\' tumulus.<ref>[[Dio Cassius]] 78.16.7.</ref>\\n\\n== Reception during antiquity ==\\n=== In Greek tragedy ===\\n{{main|Achilleis (trilogy)}}\\nThe [[tragedy|Greek tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title \\'\\'Achilleis\\'\\' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of [[Hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and guided by [[Apollo]] punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the \\'\\'Achilleis\\'\\' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the \\'\\'Achilleis\\'\\' trilogy, \\'\\'The Myrmidons\\'\\', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.<ref>Pantelis Michelakis, \\'\\'Achilles in Greek Tragedy\\'\\', 2002, p. 22</ref> In Plato\\'s \\'\\'Symposium\\'\\', Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.<ref>Plato, \\'\\'Symposium\\'\\', translated Benjamin Jowett, Dover Thrift Editions, page 8</ref>\\n\\nThe tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote \\'\\'The Lovers of Achilles\\'\\', a play with Achilles as the main character.

As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.\\n\\n=== Achilles in Roman and medieval literature ===\\nThe Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles.<ref name=\"Latacz 2010\"/> [[Virgil]] refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men,<ref>\\'\\'Aeneid\\'\\' 2.28, 1.30, 3.87.</ref> while [[Horace]] portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.<ref>\\'\\'Odes\\'\\' 4.6.17–20.</ref> Other writers, such as [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], and [[Ovid]], represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles\\' erotic career.

Self-educated, he became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849, he left the government to resume his law practice but angered by the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]]\\'s opening of the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854. He became a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and gained national attention in the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against national Democratic leader [[Stephen Douglas]] in the [[1858 and 1859 United States Senate elections|U.S Senate campaign in Illinois]]. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] and winning. Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the [[constitutional right]]s of Southern states to practice slavery. They began the process of [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\\n\\nAs the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsher treatment of the South; [[War Democrats]], who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65–87}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became an iconic call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. He suspended \\'\\'[[habeas corpus]]\\'\\', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|\\'\\'Trent\\'\\' Affair]]. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] that shut down the South\\'s trade. As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which outlawed slavery across the country.\\n\\nLincoln managed his own [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. A few days after the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House]], he was shot by [[John Wilkes Booth]], an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day.

Ingemar Düring, \\'\\'Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition\\'\\', Göteborg, 1957,{{p.|253}}}} was a Greek [[philosopher]] and [[polymath]] during the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]] in [[Ancient Greece]]. He was the founder of the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] and the [[Peripatetic school]] of philosophy and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tradition. Along with his teacher [[Plato]], he has been called the \"Father of [[Western philosophy|Western Philosophy]]\". His writings cover many subjects – including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[biology]], [[zoology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], ethics, [[aesthetics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], theatre, music, [[rhetoric]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[economics]], [[politics]] and government. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him, and it was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual [[lexicon]], as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.\\n\\nLittle is known about his life. Aristotle was born in the city of [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]] in [[Northern Greece]]. His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined [[Plato\\'s Academy]] in [[Athens]] and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ([[Circa|c.]] 347 BC).{{sfn|Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.)}} Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip II of Macedon]], tutored [[Alexander the Great]] beginning in 343 BC.{{sfn|Russell| 1972}} He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on [[papyrus]] [[scrolls]]. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication.{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=9}}\\n\\nAristotle\\'s views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]]. Some of Aristotle\\'s zoological observations found in [[Aristotle\\'s biology|his biology]], such as on the [[Hectocotylus|hectocotyl (reproductive) arm]] of the [[octopus]], were disbelieved until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as [[Peter Abelard]] and [[John Buridan]]. Aristotle\\'s influence on logic also continued well into the 19th century.\\n\\nHe influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)|Islamic thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]], as well as [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as \"The First Teacher\" and among medieval Christians like [[Thomas Aquinas]] as simply \"The Philosopher\". His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]], such as in the thinking of  [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Philippa Foot]].\\n\\n==Life==\\n[[File:20160518 092 mieza nympheum.jpg | thumb | left | School of Aristotle in [[Mieza, Macedonia|Mieza]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia, Greece]]]]\\n\\nIn general, the details of Aristotle\\'s life are not well-established.

Both of Aristotle\\'s parents died when he was about thirteen, and [[Proxenus of Atarneus]] became his guardian.{{sfn|Hall|2018|p=14}} Although little information about Aristotle\\'s childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)#Kingship and the royal court|Macedonian monarchy]].{{sfn|Anagnostopoulos|2013|page=4}}\\n\\nAt the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at [[Platonic Academy|Plato\\'s Academy]].{{sfn|Blits|1999|pp=58–63}} He probably experienced the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the Eleusinian Mysteries, \"to experience is to learn\" [παθείν μαθεĩν].{{sfn|Evans|2006}} Aristotle remained in Athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in 348/47&nbsp;BC. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy\\'s direction after control passed to Plato\\'s nephew [[Speusippus]], although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died.{{sfn|Aristotle|1984|pp=Introduction}} Aristotle then accompanied [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon. While in Lesbos, Aristotle married [[Pythias]], either Hermias\\'s adoptive daughter or niece. She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor to his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].{{sfn|Shields|2016}}{{sfn|Russell|1972}}\\n\\n[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg | thumb | upright | [[Bust (sculpture)|Portrait bust]] of Aristotle; an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] (1st or 2nd century AD) copy of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]]]]\\n\\nAristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of [[Macedon]]. During Aristotle\\'s time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]].{{sfn|Green|1991|pp=58–59}} Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and Aristotle\\'s own attitude towards [[Persia]] was unabashedly [[Ethnocentricism|ethnocentric]]. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be \"a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants\".{{sfn|Green|1991|pp=58–59}} By 335&nbsp;BC, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]]. According to the \\'\\'[[Suda]]\\'\\', he also had an \\'\\'[[eromenos|erômenos]]\\'\\', [[Palaephatus | Palaephatus of Abydus]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=88}}\\n\\nThis period in Athens, between 335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.{{sfn|Russell|1972}} He wrote many dialogues, of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include \\'\\'[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]\\'\\', \\'\\'[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]\\'\\', \\'\\'[[Nicomachean Ethics]]\\'\\', \\'\\'[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]\\'\\', \\'\\'[[On the Soul]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]\\'\\'. Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to \"logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance and theatre.\"{{sfn|Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.)}}\\n\\nNear the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander\\'s relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander\\'s death, but the only evidence of this is an [[Hagnothemis|unlikely claim]] made some six years after the death.{{sfn|Green|1991|p=460}} Following Alexander\\'s death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322&nbsp;BC, Demophilus and [[Eurymedon the Hierophant]] reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety,{{sfn|Filonik|2013|pp=72–73}} prompting him to flee to his mother\\'s family estate in [[Chalcis | Chalcis, on Euboea]], at which occasion he was said to have stated: \"I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy\"{{sfn|Jones|1980|p=216}}{{sfn|Gigon|2017|p=41}}{{sfn|Düring|1957|p=T44a-e}} – a reference to Athens\\'s [[Trial of Socrates|trial and execution of Socrates]].

The \\'\\'Rhetoric\\'\\' is not conventionally included, but it states that it relies on the \\'\\'Topics\\'\\'.{{sfn| Smith | 2017}}\\n\\n===Metaphysics===\\n{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}\\nThe word \"metaphysics\" appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle\\'s works to the treatise we know by the name \\'\\'Metaphysics\\'\\'.{{sfn| Cohen | 2000}} Aristotle called it \"first philosophy\", and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative (\\'\\'theoretikē\\'\\') philosophy which is \"theological\" and studies the divine. He wrote in his \\'\\'Metaphysics\\'\\' (1026a16):\\n\\n{{quote | if there were no other independent things besides the composite natural ones, the study of nature would be the primary kind of knowledge; but if there is some motionless independent thing, the knowledge of this precedes it and is first philosophy, and it is universal \\'\\'in just this way\\'\\', because it is first. And it belongs to this sort of philosophy to study being as being, both what it is and what belongs to it just by virtue of being.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1999 | page=111}}}}\\n\\n==== Substance ====\\n{{see | Hylomorphism }}\\n\\nAristotle examines the concepts of [[Substance theory|substance]] (\\'\\'ousia\\'\\') and [[essence]] (\\'\\'to ti ên einai\\'\\', \"the what it was to be\") in his \\'\\'Metaphysics\\'\\' (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called [[hylomorphism]]. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[Material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the \\'\\'potential\\'\\' house, while the form of the substance is the \\'\\'actual\\'\\' house, namely \\'covering for bodies and chattels\\' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=VIII 1043a 10–30}}{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}\\n\\n===== Immanent realism =====\\n[[File:Platonic and Aristotelian Forms.svg | thumb | upright=1.6 | [[Plato]]\\'s [[Theory of forms|forms]] exist as [[universals]], like the ideal form of an apple. For Aristotle, both matter and form belong to the individual thing ([[hylomorphism]]).]]\\n{{main|Aristotle\\'s theory of universals}}\\nLike his teacher Plato, Aristotle\\'s philosophy aims at the [[Problem of universals|universal]]. Aristotle\\'s [[ontology]] places the universal (\\'\\'katholou\\'\\') in [[particular]]s (\\'\\'kath\\' hekaston\\'\\'), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate.  For Aristotle, \"form\" is still what [[phenomena]] are based on, but is \"instantiated\" in a particular substance.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}\\n\\nPlato argued that all things have a [[Theory of forms|universal form]], which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyse a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but \"good\" is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the world of forms, a place where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}{{sfn| Lloyd | 1968 | pages=43–47}}\\n\\n===== Potentiality and actuality =====\\n{{see | Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)}}\\n\\nWith regard to the change (\\'\\'[[Potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]\\'\\') and its causes now, as he defines in his \\'\\'[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[On Generation and Corruption]]\\'\\' 319b–320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:\\n\\n# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;\\n# locomotion, which is change in space; and\\n# alteration, which is change in quality.\\n\\n[[File:Flute-player dolphin Alcesti Group MAN.jpg | thumb | Aristotle argued that a capability like playing the flute could be acquired – [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|the potential made actual]] – by learning.]]\\n\\nThe coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (\\'\\'[[Dunamis|dynamis]]\\'\\') and actuality (\\'\\'[[entelecheia]]\\'\\') in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (\\'\\'dynamei\\'\\') plant, and if it is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either \\'act\\' (\\'\\'poiein\\'\\') or \\'be acted upon\\' (\\'\\'paschein\\'\\'), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (\\'\\'telos\\'\\') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}\\n\\n{{quote | For that for the sake of which (\\'\\'to hou heneka\\'\\') a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=IX 1050a 5–10}}}}\\n\\nIn summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, \"what is it that makes a man one\"? Since, according to [[Plato]] there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=VIII 1045a–b}}\\n\\n===Epistemology===\\nAristotle\\'s immanent realism means his [[epistemology]] is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these.{{sfn|Smith|2017}} Aristotle uses [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from examples alongside [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], whereas Plato relies on deduction from \\'\\'[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]\\'\\' principles.{{sfn|Smith|2017}}\\n\\n==Natural philosophy==\\n\\nAristotle\\'s \"natural philosophy\" spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics, biology and other natural sciences.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}} In Aristotle\\'s terminology, \"natural philosophy\" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle\\'s work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as \"science\". Note, however, that his use of the term \\'\\'science\\'\\' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term \"scientific method\". For Aristotle, \"all science (\\'\\'dianoia\\'\\') is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (\\'\\'Metaphysics\\'\\' 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.{{sfn|Wildberg|2016}}\\n\\n===Physics===\\n[[File:Four Classical Elements in Burning Log.svg | thumb | The four [[classical element]]s (fire, air, water, earth) of [[Empedocles]] and Aristotle illustrated with a burning log.

[[John Philoponus]] (in the [[Middle Ages]]) and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotle\\'s claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}} A contrary opinion is given by [[Carlo Rovelli]], who argues that Aristotle\\'s physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the [[Earth]]\\'s gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air. In this system, heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones (whether friction is ignored, or not{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23–40}}), and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}{{efn-ua | Philoponus and Galileo correctly objected that for the transient phase (still increasing in speed) with heavy objects falling a short distance, the law does not apply: Galileo used balls on a short incline to show this.

His term \\'\\'aitia\\'\\' is traditionally translated as \"cause\", but it does not always refer to temporal sequence; it might be better translated as \"explanation\", but the traditional rendering will be employed here.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96–100, 106–07}}{{sfn| Hankinson | 1998 | page=159}}\\n* [[Material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood. It is not about action. It does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96–100, 106–07}}\\n* The [[formal cause]] is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter. It tells us what a thing is, that a thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96–100, 106–07}}\\n* The [[efficient cause]] is \"the primary source\", or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies \\'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed\\' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of \"cause\" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. In the case of two dominoes, when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96–100, 106–07}} In the case of animals, this agency is a combination of [[developmental biology|how it develops from the egg]], and [[physiology|how its body functions]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=91–92, 369–73}}\\n* The [[final cause]] (\\'\\'telos\\'\\') is its purpose, the reason why a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96–100, 106–07}} In the case of living things, it implies [[adaptation]] to a particular way of life.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=91–92, 369–73}}\\n\\n====Optics====\\n{{further | History of optics}}\\n\\nAristotle describes experiments in [[optics]] using a [[camera obscura]] in \\'\\'[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]]\\'\\', book 15.

For Aristotle, accidents, like heat waves in winter, must be considered distinct from natural causes. He was thus critical of Empedocles\\'s materialist theory of a \"survival of the fittest\" origin of living things and their organs, and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results.{{sfn| Sedley | 2007 | page=189}} To put his views into modern terms, he nowhere says that different species can have a [[common descent|common ancestor]], or that one kind can [[speciation|change into another]], or that kinds can become [[extinction|extinct]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=273}}\\n\\n====Scientific style====\\n[[File:Two of Aristotle\\'s Growth Laws.svg | thumb | left | upright=1.4 | Aristotle inferred growth laws from his observations on animals, including that [[brood size]] decreases with body mass, whereas [[gestation]] period increases.

In this sense, Aristotle\\'s biology is scientific.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=365–68}}\\n\\nFrom the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of [[biological rules|rules]] relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. [[Life expectancy|Lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]], and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, [[fecundity]] decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=408}}{{-}}\\n\\n====Classification of living things====\\n{{further | Scala naturae}}\\n[[File:Scyliorhinus retifer embryo.JPG | thumb | Aristotle recorded that the [[embryo]] of [[Mustelus canis|<!--a different species shown-->a dogfish]] was attached by a cord to a kind of placenta (the [[yolk sac]]), like a higher animal; this formed an exception to the linear scale from highest to lowest.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=72–74}}]]\\n\\nAristotle distinguished about 500 species of [[animal]]s,{{sfn| Bergstrom | Dugatkin | 2012 | page=35}}{{sfn| Rhodes | 1974 | page=7}} arranging these in the \\'\\'History of Animals\\'\\' in a graded scale of perfection, a \\'\\'[[scala naturae]]\\'\\', with man at the top. His system had eleven grades of animal, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave [[viviparity|live birth]] to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs. Animals came above [[plant]]s, and these in turn were above minerals.{{sfn| Mayr | 1982 | pages=201–02}} see also:{{sfn| Lovejoy | 1976}} He grouped what the modern zoologist would call [[vertebrate]]s as the hotter \"animals with blood\", and below them the colder [[invertebrate]]s as \"animals without blood\". Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing ([[mammal]]s), and the egg-laying ([[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[fish]]). Those without blood were insects, crustacea (non-shelled – cephalopods, and [[crustacea|shelled]]) and the hard-shelled [[mollusc]]s ([[bivalve]]s and [[gastropod]]s). He recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a [[placenta]] like the tetrapods.

Humans have a rational soul. The human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the \\'\\'[[Nous#Aristotle|nous]]\\'\\' (intellect) and \\'\\'logos\\'\\' (reason).{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=156–63}}\\n\\nFor Aristotle, the soul is the [[Hylomorphism#Body–soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).{{sfn| Shields | 2016}} In contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.{{sfn| Mason | 1979 | p=45}} Notable is Aristotle\\'s division of sensation and thought, which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].{{sfn| Guthrie | 2010 | p=348}}\\n\\n====Memory====\\n\\nAccording to Aristotle in \\'\\'On the Soul\\'\\', memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal \"appearance\" and an occurrence in the past.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=12}} In other words, a memory is a mental picture ([[wikt:phantasm|phantasm]]) that can be recovered. Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian \\'[[common sense]]\\', and thinking.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=61}}{{sfn| Carruthers | 2007 | p=16}}\\n\\nAristotle uses the term \\'memory\\' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=25}}\\n\\nBecause Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To search for these impressions, people search the memory itself.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=30}} Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. If the chain of \"images\" is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=25}} Recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression.{{sfn| Carruthers | 2007 | p=19}} Only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=296}}\\n\\n[[File:Aristotle Senses Perception Memory Dreams Action.svg | thumb | upright=2.3 | Senses, perception, memory, dreams, action in Aristotle\\'s psychology. Impressions are stored in the [[sensorium]] (the heart), linked by his [[laws of association]] (similarity, contrast, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]]).]]\\n\\nAristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]], described in his [[laws of association]]. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=259}}{{sfn | Sorabji | 2006 | p=54}}\\n\\n====Dreams====\\n{{see | Dream#Classical history}}\\n\\nAristotle describes sleep in \\'\\'On Sleep and Wakefulness\\'\\'.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115–18}} or of digestion,{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} so it is vital to the body.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115–18}} While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire, which is the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep,{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115–18}} albeit differently,{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} unless they are weary.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115–18}}\\n\\nDreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115–18}} Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then look away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115–18}} However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience.{{sfn| Modrak | 2009 | pp=169–81}} During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} This leads the person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in nature.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} In \\'\\'De Anima\\'\\' iii 3, Aristotle ascribes the ability to create, to store, and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination, \\'\\'phantasia\\'\\'.{{sfn| Shields | 2016}}\\n\\nOne component of Aristotle\\'s theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences.{{sfn| Webb | 1990 | pages=174–84}} Aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences.{{sfn| Modrak | 2009 | pp=169–81}}\\n\\n==Practical philosophy==\\n\\nAristotle\\'s practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics, politics, economics, and rhetoric.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}}\\n\\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" align=right style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\\n|+ Virtues and their accompanying vices{{sfn|Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.)}}\\n!

In Aristotelian philosophy, the abolition of what he considers \"[[natural slavery]]\" would undermine civic [[freedom]]. The pursuit of freedom is inseparable from pursuing mastery over \"those who deserve to be slaves\". According to \\'\\'The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle\\'s Politics\\'\\' the targets of this aggressive warfare were non-Greeks, noting Aristotle\\'s view that \"our poets say \\'it is proper for Greeks to rule non-Greeks\\'\".{{sfn|Deslauriers|Destrée|2013|pp=157-162}}\\n\\nAristotle generally has a favorable opinion of war, extolling it as a chance for [[virtue]] and writing that \"the leisure that accompanies peace\" tends to make people \"arrogant\". War to \"avoid becoming enslaved to others\" is justified as self-defense. He writes that war \"compels people to be just and temperate\", however, in order to be just \"war must be chosen for the sake of peace\" (with the exception of wars of aggression discussed above).{{sfn|Deslauriers|Destrée|2013|pp=157-162}}\\n\\n===Ethics===\\n\\n{{main | Aristotelian ethics}}\\n\\nAristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the \\'\\'[[Nicomachean Ethics]]\\'\\'.{{sfn| Kraut | 2001}}\\n\\nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (\\'\\'ergon\\'\\') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the \\'\\'[[De Anima|psuchē]]\\'\\' (\\'\\'soul\\'\\') in accordance with reason (\\'\\'[[logos]]\\'\\'). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity (the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency{{sfn| Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.)}}) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, \\'\\'[[eudaimonia]]\\'\\', generally translated as \"happiness\" or sometimes \"well being\". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (\\'\\'ēthikē\\'\\' \\'\\'[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]\\'\\'), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence.{{sfn| Nicomachean Ethics | ps= &nbsp;Book I. See for example chapter 7.}}\\n\\nAristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (\\'\\'[[phronesis]]\\'\\') and their intellect (\\'\\'[[nous]]\\'\\') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.{{sfn| Nicomachean Ethics | p= Book VI}}\\n\\n===Politics===\\n\\n{{main | Politics (Aristotle)}}\\n\\nIn addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled \\'\\'[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]\\'\\'. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, \"for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part\".{{sfn| Politics | pp=1253a19–24}} He also famously stated that \"man is by nature a political animal\" and also arguing that humanity\\'s defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality.{{sfn| Aristotle | 2009 | pages=320–21}} Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle\\'s conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.{{sfn| Ebenstein | Ebenstein | 2002 | page=59}}\\n\\n[[File:Aristotle\\'s constitutions.svg | thumb|upright=1.7 | Aristotle\\'s classifications of political constitutions]]\\n\\nThe common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle\\'s understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (\\'\\'[[polis]]\\'\\') which functions as a political \"community\" or \"partnership\" (\\'\\'koinōnia\\'\\')<!-- (1252a1) -->. The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability<!-- (1280b29–31) -->, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: \"The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together<!-- (1281a1–3) -->.\" This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of \"fear of violent death\" or its \"inconveniences.\"{{efn-ua | For a different reading of social and economic processes in the \\'\\'Nicomachean Ethics\\'\\' and \\'\\'Politics\\'\\' see Polanyi, Karl (1957) \"Aristotle Discovers the Economy\" in \\'\\'Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi\\'\\' ed. G. Dalton, Boston 1971, 78–115.}}\\n\\nIn \\'\\'[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protrepticus]]\\'\\', the character \\'Aristotle\\' states:{{sfn| Hutchinson | Johnson | 2015 | p=22}}\\n\\n{{quote | For we all agree that the most excellent man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it\\'s evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.{{sfn| Hutchinson | Johnson | 2015 | p=22}}}}\\n\\n===Economics===\\n{{main | Politics (Aristotle)}}\\n\\nAristotle made substantial contributions to [[economics|economic thought]], especially to thought in the Middle Ages.{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20–24}} In \\'\\'[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]\\'\\', Aristotle addresses the city, [[property]], and [[trade]]. His response to criticisms of [[private property]], in [[Lionel Robbins]]\\'s view, anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists, as it related to the overall [[utility]] of social arrangements.{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20–24}} Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from [[human nature]]. In \\'\\'Politics\\'\\', Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of [[money]].{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20–24}} Money came into use because people became dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or [[silver]].{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16–28}}\\n\\nAristotle\\'s discussions on [[retail]] and [[interest]] was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a [[profit (economics)|profit]]. It thus uses goods as a means to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the money itself, and not from its use.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16–28}}\\n\\nAristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement. Money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them \"commensurable\".{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16–28}} He goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange, making it a sort of security. That is, \"if we do not want a thing now, we shall be able to get it when we do want it\".{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16–28}}\\n\\n===Rhetoric and poetics===\\n[[File:Bénigne Gagneraux, The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods.jpg | thumb | upright=1.3 | \\'\\'The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods\\'\\' (1784) by [[Bénigne Gagneraux]]. In his \\'\\'[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]\\'\\', Aristotle uses the tragedy \\'\\'[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus Tyrannus]]\\'\\' by [[Sophocles]] as an example of how the perfect tragedy should be structured, with a generally good protagonist who starts the play prosperous, but loses everything through some \\'\\'[[hamartia]]\\'\\' (fault).{{sfn| Kaufmann | 1968 | pages=56–60}}]]\\n{{main | Rhetoric (Aristotle) | Poetics (Aristotle)}}\\n\\nAristotle\\'s \\'\\'Rhetoric\\'\\' proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience: \\'\\'[[ethos]]\\'\\' (an appeal to the speaker\\'s character), \\'\\'[[pathos]]\\'\\' (an appeal to the audience\\'s emotion), and \\'\\'[[logos]]\\'\\' (an appeal to logical reasoning).{{sfn| Garver | 1994 | pages=109–10}} He also categorises rhetoric into three genres: [[epideictic]] (ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame), [[Forensic rhetoric|forensic]] (judicial speeches over guilt or innocence), and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] (speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue).{{sfn| Rorty | 1996 | pages=3–7}} Aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical [[Proof (truth)|proofs]]: \\'\\'[[enthymeme]]\\'\\' (proof by [[syllogism]]) and \\'\\'[[paradeigma]]\\'\\' (proof by example).{{sfn| Grimaldi | 1998 | p=71}}\\n\\nAristotle writes in his \\'\\'Poetics\\'\\' that [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb | dithyrambic poetry]], painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of \\'\\'[[mimesis]]\\'\\' (\"imitation\"), each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152–59}}{{sfn| Poetics | p= I 1447a}} He applies the term \\'\\'mimesis\\'\\' both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist\\'s intention{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152–59}} and contends that the audience\\'s realisation of the \\'\\'mimesis\\'\\' is vital to understanding the work itself.{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152–59}} Aristotle states that \\'\\'mimesis\\'\\' is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152–59}}{{sfn| Poetics | p= IV}} and that all human artistry \"follows the pattern of nature\".{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152–59}} Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what [[Stephen Halliwell (academic)|Stephen Halliwell]] calls \"highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes.\"{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152–59}} For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.{{sfn| Poetics | p=III}}\\n\\nWhile it is believed that Aristotle\\'s \\'\\'Poetics\\'\\' originally comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.{{sfn| Poetics | p=VI}} The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes \\'\\'Poetics\\'\\' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.{{sfn| Poetics | p=XXVI}} Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].{{sfn| Aesop | 1998 | pages=Introduction, xi–xii}}\\n\\n===Views on women===\\n{{main | Aristotle\\'s views on women}}\\n{{further | Aristotle\\'s biology#Inheritance}}\\n\\nAristotle\\'s analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element.

Aristotle\\'s influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter\\'s bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle\\'s geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained \"Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men\\'s common property?\"{{sfn| Plutarch | 1919 | p= Part 1, 7:7}}\\n\\n===On Hellenistic science===\\n{{details | Ancient Greek medicine}}\\n\\nAfter Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work.

[[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Alpharabius]], who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers.

After recapitulating the \"walking\" themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final \"Grandioso\".\\n\\n==Instrumentation==\\n\\'\\'An American in Paris\\'\\' is scored for 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|B-flat]], [[bass clarinet]] in B-flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]] in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in B-flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood block]], [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[Tom-tom drum|tom-toms]], [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 [[vehicle horn|taxi horns]] labeled as A, B, C and D with circles around them, [[alto saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone saxophone]], (all saxophones doubling soprano saxophones) and [[String section|strings]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/47d1f79a-8ea6-4aba-964f-989cb5dc2cd7/fullview#page/4/mode/2up|title=George Gershwin: An American in Paris (original score)|website=New York Philharmonic Archives|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904200637/http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/47d1f79a-8ea6-4aba-964f-989cb5dc2cd7/fullview#page/4/mode/2up|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=September 4, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes A, B, C and D, it has recently come to light<ref name=\"nytimes1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/theater/have-we-been-playing-gershwin-wrong-for-70-years.html|title=Have We Been Playing Gershwin Wrong for 70 Years?|author=Michael Cooper|date=March 1, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 6, 2016 }}</ref> that Gershwin\\'s intention was to have used the notes A{{Music|flat}}<sub>[[Scientific pitch notation|4]]</sub>, B{{Music|flat}}<sub>4</sub>, D<sub>5</sub>, and A<sub>4</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music.umich.edu/ami/gershwin/?p=715 |title=1929 Gershwin Taxi Horn Photo Clarifies Mystery|publisher=[[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance]]|date=March 5, 2016|accessdate=April 6, 2016 }}</ref> It is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as A, B, C and D with circles, he may have been referring to the use of the four different horns and not the notes that they played.\\n\\nThe revised edition by F.

He stated that Damrosch\\'s sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with \"a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses.\" Critics believed that \\'\\'An American in Paris\\'\\' was better crafted than his lukewarm [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]. Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[César Franck]], [[Richard Wagner]], or [[Guillaume Lekeu]] on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics, \"It\\'s not a Beethoven Symphony, you know... It\\'s a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It\\'s not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds.\"<ref name=\"Pollack2007\" />\\n\\n==Preservation status==\\n\\nOn September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological [[Historical editions (music)|critical edition]] of the full orchestral score will be eventually released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[University of Michigan]], are working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin\\'s true intent. It is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material Gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section), or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin\\'s composition process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/new-critical-edition-of-george-and-ira-gershwins-works-to-be-compiled/ |title=New, critical edition of George and Ira Gershwin\\'s works to be compiled &#124; PBS NewsHour |website=Pbs.org |date=September 14, 2013 |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}</ref>\\n\\nThe score to \\'\\'An American in Paris\\'\\' is currently scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released.

The first recording was made for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Gershwin was on hand to \"supervise\" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. This recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended using the notes A-flat, B-flat, a higher D and a lower A.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" /> The radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which \\'\\'An American in Paris,\\'\\' also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set. [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music. In 1945, [[Arturo Toscanini]] conducting the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] recorded the piece for [[RCA Victor]], one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer. The [[Seattle Symphony]] also recorded a version in 1990 of Gershwin\\'s original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bargreen |first=Melinda |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900628&slug=1079541 |title=Entertainment & the Arts &#124; Recordings &#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |website=Community.seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=June 28, 1990 |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}</ref> [[Harry James]] released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album \\'\\'One Night Stand,\\'\\' recorded live at the [[Aragon Ballroom (Chicago)|Aragon Ballroom in Chicago]] ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]] GL 522 and CL 522).\\n\\n==Use in film==\\nIn 1951, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] released the musical film \\'\\'[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]\\'\\', featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Leslie Caron]].

Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15&nbsp;minutes.\\n\\nWinners were announced to media three months earlier. That was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.<ref name=\"history\" /> This method was used until 1940, when the \\'\\'[[Los Angeles Times]]\\'\\' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners.<ref name=\"history\" />\\n\\n===Notable milestones===\\nThe first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in \\'\\'[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[The Way of All Flesh (1927 film)|The Way of All Flesh]]\\'\\'. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films.

It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)\\n\\nThe Academy Awards is the world\\'s longest-running awards show televised live in all U.S. time zones (excluding territories outside mainland North America), Canada, and the United Kingdom, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/oscars-what-were-the-longest-ceremony-telecasts-in-academy-awards-history-1.11488884|title=What was the longest Oscars telecast ever?|website=Newsday|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>. The Oscars were first televised in [[25th Academy Awards|1953]] by [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until [[32nd Academy Awards|1960]], when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in [[38th Academy Awards|1966]]) through [[42nd Academy Awards|1970]].

The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by [[56th Academy Awards|1984]], the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.\\n\\nThe ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February, since [[76th Academy Awards|2004]], to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the [[NCAA Division I Men\\'s Basketball Tournament|NCAA Basketball Tournament]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. (In [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and [[49th Academy Awards|1977]], ABC\\'s regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite NBC\\'s NCAA title game.) The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March in order to avoid a clash with the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]], which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscars-academy-awards-date-changes_n_5cffe0dee4b02c23d2d2860e|title=The Oscars Are Experimenting With A Series Of Date Changes|last=Fang|first=Marina|date=2019-06-11|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast.
